## Question 1: Website Creation
I created a **personal music promotion website** for DJ CHANX JR.  
The site contains:
- **Homepage** with artist name, tagline, and navigation  
- **About Section** with biography and artist image  
- **Music Section** with track list and audio player  
- **Shows Section** with upcoming events in a

## Question 2: HTML Elements
1. **Challenging Elements**
   - `<form>`: Managing labels, inputs, and validation.  
   - `<table>`: Aligning rows and headers properly.  
   - `<audio>`: Ensuring playback controls worked.  
   - `<img>`: Handling attributes like `alt`, `width`, `height`.  
   - `<nav>`: Linking sections smoothly with anchor tags.  

2. **Semantic Elements Usage**
   - `<header>`: Introduced the site with navigation.  
   - `<section>`: Divided content into About, Music, Shows, and Contact.  
   - `<footer>`: Closed with copyright and back‑to‑top link.  

3. **Most Useful Element**
   - `<section>` was most useful for organizing layout because it grouped related content logically.

## Question 3: HTML Attributes
1. **Essential Attributes**
   - `href` (for navigation links)  
   - `src` (for images and audio)  
   - `action` (for form submission)  

2. **Class vs. ID**
   - `class`: Used for styling groups of elements (e.g., artist name, tagline).  
   - `id`: Used for unique identifiers (e.g., linking to specific sections like `#contact`).  

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - `alt` attribute improved accessibility by describing images for screen readers.

## Question 4: Development Process
1. **Planning**
   - Sketched a wireframe with sections: Home, About, Music, Shows, Contact.  
   - Listed required elements and attributes.  

2. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Opened the HTML file in browser after each major change.  
   - Used developer tools to inspect structure and fix errors.  

3. **Challenges**
   - Embedding audio correctly → solved by checking `source` syntax.  
   - Ensuring semantic correctness → reviewed W3C guidelines.

## Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation
1. **Git Commands**
   - `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push origin main`.  

2. **Commits**
   - Around 10 commits, each with descriptive messages like “Added About section” or “Fixed table layout”.  

3. **Importance of Version Control**
   - Tracks changes, prevents data loss, enables collaboration.
